      title:
        Commemoration of the 76th anniversary of the liberation of Stalag X B
        Sandbostel
      text: |-
        Also this year, on April 29, we cannot commemorate together in Sandbostel the liberation of Stalag X B and remember those who suffered and died here. We will again celebrate the commemoration in a digital form. For this purpose, on the anniversary of the liberation, video clips with greetings from politicians and diplomats, contributions of students, and speeches from survivors and relatives will be released. There will also be another participatory project in which you, who might otherwise have come to Sandbostel, can actively participate.
        In the form you can express your thoughts on the day of liberation of Stalag X B or about the person you mourn. Also, you can attach a photo of your loved one, of you and your family, a document, a drawing, or any other image that is important to you. The texts and images will be published together with your location on an interactive world map at <a href="https://www.sandbostel76.de">www.sandbostel76.de</a> from mid-April.
        Submissions made later will be supplemented. The entry form will remain online until May 9 and contributions submitted by the deadline will be supplemented. Thus, on the 76th anniverary ot the liberation of Stalag X B, a digital memorial is being created that shows how global the memory of Sandbostel is.
        We are looking forward to your contributions â€“ thank you very much!
